The mapping toolkit is a pack of patches / modules dedicated to projection mapping. The first two are:

MAPPING TOOLKIT - SVG
A tool to animate SVG files, and produce visual content simply, and in realtime. Classic points and lines animations are available, and it's easy to add more animations.

MAPPING TOOLKIT - WARPING
A texture sampling, output warping patch: crop, sample any texture (image, remote content, video, generative animation), and then distort, warp that texture on the video output. Useful for multiple output, and simple warping to re align a projection mapping.

These patches are still incomplete, but expect regular updates here, and feel free to ask for new features and questions.
