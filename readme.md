# Mapping Toolkit from [AntiVJ](http://www.antivj.com)

Developped by Joanie Lemercier
This is a small collection of simple patches to do projection mapping.

This version is more an introduction to github (thanks Kyle) than an actual release, and I will push something more consistent over the next few days.
